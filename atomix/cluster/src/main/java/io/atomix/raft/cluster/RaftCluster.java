/**
 * Raft server cluster API.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the view of the Raft cluster from the perspective of a single server. When
 * a {@link RaftServer RaftServer} is started, the server will form a cluster with other servers.
 * Each Raft cluster consists of some set of {@link #getMembers() members}, and each {@link
 * RaftMember} represents a single server in the cluster. Users can use the {@code Cluster} to react
 * to state changes in the underlying Raft algorithm via the various listeners.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * server.cluster().onJoin(member -> {
 *   System.out.println(member.address() + " joined the cluster!");
 * });
 *
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Membership exposed via this interface is provided from the perspective of the local server and
 * may not necessarily be consistent with cluster membership from the perspective of other nodes.
 * The only consistent membership list is on the {@link #getLeader() leader} node.
 *
 * <h2>Cluster management</h2>
 *
 * Users can use the {@code Cluster} to manage the Raft cluster membership. Typically, servers join
 * the cluster by calling {@link RaftServer#bootstrap(MemberId...)}.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * server.cluster().onJoin(member -> {
 *   member.remove().thenRun(() -> System.out.println("Removed " + member.address() + " from the cluster!"));
 * });
 *
 * }</pre>
 *
 * When a member is removed from the cluster, the configuration change removing the member will be
 * replicated to all the servers in the cluster and persisted to disk. Once a member has been
 * removed, for that member to rejoin the cluster it must fully restart and request to rejoin the
 * cluster. Cluster configurations are stored on disk.
 *
 * <p>Additionally, members can be {@link RaftMember#promote() promoted} and {@link
 * RaftMember#demote() demoted} by any other member of the cluster. When a member state is changed,
 * a cluster configuration change request is sent to the cluster leader where it's logged and
 * replicated through the Raft consensus algorithm. <em>During</em> the configuration change,
 * servers' cluster configurations will be updated. Once the configuration change is complete, it
 * will be persisted to disk on all servers and is guaranteed not to be lost even in the event of a
 * full cluster shutdown.
